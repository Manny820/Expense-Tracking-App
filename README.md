<div class="overview"> 
  <p>Here is an overview of my Expense Tracking Application with informative descriptions and UI examples explaining
      how each feature works and how a user would interact with it. It is able to keep track of user inputted transactions, 
      categorize them, and store them for later viewing or modifications. This application was built primarily in JAVA            using Andriod Studio IDE.</p>
</div>

<div class="home-page">
  <h2>Home Page</h2>
  <p>This would be the Home Page a user would see when opening the application. It gives a brief summary of all transactions,
      total amount spent, total amount received from paychecks, and what type of category each transaction is.</p>

</div>

<div class="transactions"> 
  <h2>Transactions</h2>
  <p>There are two types of transactions which are positive and negative transactions. Positive transactions are amounts 
      inputted from paychecks or money received. Negative transactions are any expenses the user has made and would like 
      to keep track of.</p>

</div>

<div class="categories"> 
  <h2>Categories Page</h2>
  <p>This page can be reached by the Home Page and shows every category type that can be inputted. A user is then
      able to click on whichever category and instantly receive a list of all transactions within that category.</p>

</div>

<div class="summary-deletion">
  <h2>Transaction Summary</h2>
  <p>Once a transaction is clicked, the Summary UI will pop up and show all information stored for desired transaction
      pressed. It will appear green if positive and red if negative. Each transaction can also be deleted.</p>

<div class="additions">
  <h2>Adding New Transactions </h2>
  <p>This Page can also be reached by the Home Page and is where a user would input new transactions that they would
      like to track. Each new transaction is automatically stored and categorized within the other pages as well.</p>
